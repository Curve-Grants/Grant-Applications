# Submitting a Grant Application

Make sure to follow the grant application template outlined in [Grant-Applications/README.md](https://github.com/Curve-Grants/Grant-Applications/blob/main/README.md).

Submit a PR to this folder (Application-for-review) with file format `year-month-day_ProjectTitle_TeamOrApplicantName.md`
For instance, an application submitted on July 27, 2023 with project title "crvUSD Risk Dashboard" by team X Labs would submit their application as `2023-07-27_crvUSDRiskDashboard_XLabs.md`.

Make sure to include a good contact in the application and a member of the Grant Council will contact you after your proposal has been reviewed. 

For any additional information or inquiry about your pending application, vist the [Curve Ecosystem Grants TG channel](https://t.me/curve_grants).
