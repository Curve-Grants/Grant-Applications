# Grant Applications
### A repo for Curve ecosystem grant applicants to post their proposals for review

## Ecosystem Grants

Ecosystem grants aim to support the development of Curve, the Vyper language, and the DeFi ecosystem in general. They are for individuals and teams of all sizes that provide public goods services and tooling.

The following criteria are considered:

- How it relates to Curve and the Curve DAO
- How it may benefit and impact Curve and the Curve community
- State of the project (is it some gibberish on a napkin or already in production)
- The team and how likely they are to deliver
- Potential (viability, longevity, competition and so on)
- How the funds will be used and why they are needed

These grants are quite flexible in how they are awarded with an emphasis on demonstrably benefiting the Curve ecosystem. Existing and completed projects are also eligible, particularly if they can demonstrate benefit to the ecosystem.

A council of team and community members reviews applications and awards grants, which may involve milestone-based repeat payments depending on the scope of the project.
